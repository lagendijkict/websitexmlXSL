# How to host on Pythonanywhere ?
The account is free, if you want to follow along, you need these settings:
- Source code: /home/username/projectname
- Working directory: /home/username/projectname/templates/
Change the path names to the files in the code to just the filename, because your working directory is right inside the templates folder
where the files are.

# Other
## Docker
The Dockerfile can be used to package the app into a container for deployment.
